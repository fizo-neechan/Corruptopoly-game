# Corruptopoly - A Game by Law Abiding Citizens

Game created by @fizo_neechan and @r2ja


This game is out take on monopoly - a reimagined of the basic monopoly with a twist of pakistani politics.

The game is completely self-made, made with basic concepts of C++ and SFML library.
The basic data structures used in the making of the game are:
 - Stack - To emulate a deck of drawable cards
 - Circular linked list - To emulate the board and board positions and to be able to easily move players around the board
