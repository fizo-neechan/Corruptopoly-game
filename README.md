# Corruptopoly - A Game by Law Abiding Citizens

Game created by @fizo_neechan and @r2ja


In its essence, Corrupt-o-poly is a spinoff based on the popular game“Monopoly”.
It follows a parodied version of the political climate of a “certain” country,whereas all characters are fictional and not depictions of real characters.All prompts, sprites, and properties are based on non-fictional places

The game is completely self-made, made with basic concepts of C++ and SFML library.
The basic data structures used in the making of the game are:
 - Stack - To emulate a deck of drawable cards
 - Circular linked list - To emulate the board and board positions and to be able to easily move players around the board
 - Arrays - if you consider them data structures :)
